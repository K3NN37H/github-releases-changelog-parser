# Github Repository Releases Change Log Parser

Collects a large number of releases in a Github repo onto a single page for easy viewing and searching.

## Motivation

Some repos maintain their change logs only within Github release descriptions. This can make it somewhat problematic when trying to look for indications of breaking changes in release notes, especially when the repo has a large number of releases.

This app will collect the releases onto one page and highlight releases that contain the word "breaking", making it easier to find breaking changes or some other keyword using "Find in page."
